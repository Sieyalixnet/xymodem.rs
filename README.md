# XYMODEM.rs

The XMODEM and YMODEM protocols in Rust.

The YMODEM implementation uses code from the original xmodem.rs [crate](https://crates.io/crates/xmodem) by awelkie.
The XMODEM contained in this package is the same as the [original code](https://github.com/awelkie/xmodem.rs) with some minor tweaks.

# Testing
The tests require the binaries found in the `lrzsz` package.
Currently, tests only work for XModem.
